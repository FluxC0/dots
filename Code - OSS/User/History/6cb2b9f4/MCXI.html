        <h1>What makes this website spooky?</h1>
        <p> I designed the CSS in a way that gives off that halloween feel, while still managing to avoid any javascript at all.
            Is it much? NO! is it still cool? YES!

        <h1>So.... Who AM I anyways?</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Basil. Basil Engel. Resounding Non-Binary
            Pal that does computer science stuff. Pretty cool, I think.
            I'm a Minor (all you need to know anyways) and am fluent in Python
            and have worked on a few discord bots, like allthingslinux's <a href="https://github.com/allthingslinux/tux">Tux</a>
